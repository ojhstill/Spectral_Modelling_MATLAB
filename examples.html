  <h1 class="font-weight-lighter">SYSTEM EXAMPLES</h1>
  <p>
    To demonstrate the system’s capabilities, four acoustics samples consisting of different timbral qualities will be
    transformed and comparatively analysed. Each should provide you with various examples of audio based effects that
    can be achieved via the system. The samples will first be theorised and validated to the system’s output before
    being transformed by the user parameters.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-weight-lighter">1. TUNED WIND INSTRUMENT</h2>
  <p>
    For a flute sample, we would expect the system to be able to sufficiently separate both tonal and acoustic noise
    elements. The fundamental frequencies should be the most prominent in the deterministic part with each timbral
    harmonic above decaying in amplitude, while the stochastic part should be largely active as the flute is excited by
    the movement of air.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_FluteParts.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Flute Parts">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/flute_det.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/flute_sto.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 13: Spectral Parts of a Flute.</p>
  <p>
    As expected, we can locate the fundamentals of each note within the deterministic signal while observing the rising
    harmonic overtones. The chaotic high frequency sinusoids within the deterministic spectrum can be regarded as
    anomalies as result of the system’s performance. Meanwhile, the stochastic part demonstrates the timbral breathiness
    of the flute with the onset and offset of each note being clearly defined in the spectrogram. To transform the
    sample, the pitch transposing is set to 12 while the resonance balance is set to 97%. This should double each
    sinusoidal frequency and decrease the magnitude of the stochastic part.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_FluteComp.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Flute Comparison">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/flute.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/flute_synth.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 14: Comparison of Original and Resynthesised Flute Sample.</p>
  <p>
    Visually, our output is exactly as theorised and thus validates our system’s behaviour. Aurally, the sound produced
    sounds distinctively more resonant and thin, however this is likely due to the reduced low-mid range from the
    stochastic part and the transposition of deterministic fundamentals.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-weight-lighter">2. PERCUSSIVE HIT</h2>
  <p>
    For a percussive snare hit we would expect much more stochastic information, similar to that of an impulse response,
    and very little resonance apart from any slight acoustic tuning.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_SnareParts.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Snare Parts">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/snare_det.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/snare_sto.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 15: Spectral Parts of a Snare Hit.</p>
  <p>
    We could adjust the tuning of the snare hit, however for this example we will instead remove all tuning by setting
    the resonance balance to 0%. Here, we will compare the original audio spectrogram to the resynthesised system output
    to show the overall effect to the timbral domain output.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_SnareComp.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Snare Comparison">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/snare.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/snare_sto.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 16: Comparison of Original and Resynthesised Snare Hit.</p>
  <p>
    Although the spectrums appear to be nearly identical, the resynthesised audio resembles more of a clap than the
    original snare. This is due to any oscillations caused by an acoustic skin membrane being removed completely,
    leaving only the impulse decay. These oscillations can be found in the original audio spectrum as subtle parallel
    horizontal lines near the bottom of the frequency axis.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-weight-lighter">3. TUNED PLUCKED INSTRUMENT</h2>
  <p>
    For a tuned plucked instrument such as a lute, we can expect somewhat of a mixture between our tuned instrument and
    percussive hit analysis.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_LuteParts.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Lute Parts">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/lute_det.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/lute_sto.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 17: Spectral Parts of a Lute.</p>
  <p>
    Once again, we can clearly see the note onsets within the stochastic part due to the displacement excitation caused
    by each pluck. This is accompanied by the many harmonics found in the deterministic part from the timbral vibrations
    of the string and instrument body. We can accentuate the plucking acoustics of the audio by transposing up and
    adjusting the resonance balance.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_LuteComp.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Lute Comparison">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/lute.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/lute_synth.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 18: Comparison of Original and Resynthesised Lute Sample.</p>
  <p>
    The sinusoidal content is transposed up by 19 semitones with the resonance balance set to 5%, creating a much
    sharper pluck effect from the much higher frequency register.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-weight-lighter">4. HUMAN SINGING VOICE</h2>
  <p>
    For an operatic female vocal sample, we would expect very similar results to a tuned wind instrument as both are
    excited by the movement of air.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_VocalsParts.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Vocal Parts">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/vocal_det.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/vocal_sto.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 19: Spectral Parts of Vocal Sample.</p>
  <p>
    Along with the fundamental and harmonic elements, we can also visually see some tonal dynamics and vocal
    articulation. Using the system, we could try transforming the female singer voice to sound more like a male singer.
    We can roughly achieve this by pitching the deterministic part down two whole tones and decreasing the resonance to
    sound more gruff. This would increase the magnitude of the stochastic part while lowering the singer’s average
    fundamental.
  </p>
  <img class="w-100 mt-3" src="./rsc/img/Spec_VocalsComp.jpg" alt="Spectrogram Vocal Comparison">
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/vocal.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
    <audio controls><source src="rsc/audio/vocal_synth.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
  </div>
  <p class="img-caption">Figure 20: Comparison of Original and Resynthesised Vocal Sample.</p>
  <p>
    Comparing the original to the transformed, the formants don’t completely match or sound too realistic, however the
    resynthesised audio does resemble a much deeper and huskier voice.
